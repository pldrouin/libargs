# libargs
The libargs library allows an executable to use variable input parameters. Parameter names can be identified using simply a keyword, or a keyword preceded by one or more '-' characters. Parameter and
their arguments can be separated by a space character as defined by the isspace function, or by either ':' or '='. The '#' character is used for comments. The library also allows to load configuration files to read parameters.
Parameters can be loaded from the command line, configuration files or the
standard input.
